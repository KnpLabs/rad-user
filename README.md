# Usages

## I want to auto-generate my user salt

> The salt feature is deprecated since PHP 5.5 and BCrypt usage. Please upgrade your version of PHP and use BCrypt.

Your User model should implement the `Knp\Rad\User\HasSalt` interface.

```php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Knp\Rad\User\HasSalt;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class User implements HasSalt
{
    use HasSalt\HasSalt; //You can also use this trait

    /**
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue
     * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
     */
    private $id;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column
     */
    private $salt;
}
```

Now, before your user is inserted into your database, the salt will be auto-generated.

## I want to auto-generate my user password

Your User model should implement the `Knp\Rad\User\HasInitialPassword` interface.

```php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Knp\Rad\User\HasInitialPassword;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class User implements HasInitialPassword
{
    use HasInitialPassword\HasInitialPassword; // You can also use this trait

    /**
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue
     * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
     */
    private $id;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column
     */
    private $password;
}
```

Now, before your user is inserted or updated into your database, then the plain password will be automaticly generated.

## I want to auto-encode my user password

Your User model should implement the `Knp\Rad\User\HasPassword` interface.

```php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Knp\Rad\User\HasPassword;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class User implements HasPassword
{
    use HasPassword\HasPassword; // You can also use this trait

    /**
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue
     * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
     */
    private $id;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column
     */
    private $password;
}
```

Now, before your user is inserted or updated into your database, if you have set the attribute 'plainPassword', then the password will be automaticly generated.

# WARNING

The `Knp\Rad\User\HasPassword\HasPassword` trait use the `Knp\Rad\User\HasInitialPassword\HasInitialPassword` trait. So don't use both into the same class or you will have a method conflict.

# Some tips

## Using with MongoDB or CouchDB Object Document Mapper

The knp/rad-user library is also compatible with MongoDB and CouchDB
